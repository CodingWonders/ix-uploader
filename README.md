ix.io Uploader is a simple C# tool to upload text files to ix.io. This program uses `curl` to upload the file and return a link.

## How to use?
ix.io Uploader is easy to use. Simply specify a file by clicking "Browse..." and click "Upload" (if the "Upload automatically" check box is not checked, otherwise it's uploaded automatically)

The uploader will then give you a link with the file's contents. You have some options below the link, like going to it (in case you want to check if it's uploaded it) or copying it to the clipboard for later sharing.

## What's implemented?
- ix.io upload capability
